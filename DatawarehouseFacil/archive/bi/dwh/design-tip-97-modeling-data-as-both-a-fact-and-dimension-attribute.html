							<p>In the dimensional modeling world, we try very hard to separate data into two contrasting camps:Â numerical measurements that we put into fact tables, and textual descriptors that we put intoÂ dimension tables as â€œattributesâ€. If only life were that easyâ€¦</p>
							<p>Remember that numerical facts usually have an implicit time series of observations, and usuallyÂ participate in numerical computations such as sums and averages, or more complex functionalÂ expressions. Dimension attributes, on the other hand, are the targets of constraints, and provide theÂ content of â€œrow headersâ€ (grouping columns) in a query.</p>
							<p>While probably 98% of all data items are neatly separated into either facts or dimension attributes,Â there is a solid 2% that donâ€™t fit so neatly into these two categories. A classic example that we haveÂ taught for years is the price of a product. Is this an attribute of the product dimension or is this anÂ observed fact? In our opinion, this one is an easy choice. Since the price of a product often variesÂ over time and over location, it becomes very cumbersome to model the price as a dimensionÂ attribute. It should be a fact. But it is normal to decide this rather late in the design process.</p>
							<p>A more ambiguous example is the limit on a coverage within an automobile insurance policy. The limitÂ is a numerical data item, say $300,000 for collision liability. The limit may not change over the life ofÂ the policy, or it changes very infrequently. Furthermore, many queries would group or constrain onÂ this limit data item. This sounds like a slam dunk for the limit being an attribute of the coverageÂ dimension.</p>
							<p>But, the limit is a numeric observation, and it can change over time, albeit slowly. One could poseÂ some important queries summing or averaging all the limits on many policies and coverages. ThisÂ sounds like a slam dunk for the limit being a numeric fact in a fact table.<br>
							Rather than agonizing over the dimension versus fact choice, simply model it BOTH ways! IncludeÂ the limit in the coverage dimension so that it participates in the usual way as a target for constraintsÂ and the content for row headers, but also put the limit in the fact table so it can participate in the usualÂ way within complex computations.</p>
							<p>This example illustrates some important dimensional modeling themes:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Your design goal is ease-of-use, not elegance. In the final step of preparing data forÂ consumption by end users, we should be willing to stand on our heads to make our BIÂ systems understandable and fast. That means 1) transferring work into the ETL backÂ room, and 2) tolerating more storage overhead in order to simplify the final dataÂ presentation.</li>
							<li>In correctly designed models, there is never a meaningful difference in data contentÂ between two opposing approaches. Stop arguing that â€œyou CANâ€™T do the query if youÂ model it that wayâ€. That is almost never true. The issues that you should focus on areÂ ease of application development, and understandability when presented through an endÂ user interface.</li>
