							<p>Many of you are already familiar with the data warehouse bus architecture and matrix given theirÂ central role in building architected data marts. The corresponding bus matrix identifies the key business processes of anÂ organization, along with their associated dimensions. Business processes (typically corresponding toÂ major source systems) are listed as matrix rows, while dimensions appear as matrix columns. TheÂ cells of the matrix are then marked to indicate which dimensions apply to which processes.</p>
							<p>In a single document, the data warehouse team has a tool for planning the overall data warehouse,Â identifying the shared dimensions across the enterprise, coordinating the efforts of separateÂ implementation teams, and communicating the importance of shared dimensions throughout theÂ organization. We firmly believe drafting a bus matrix is one of the key initial tasks to be completed byÂ every data warehouse team after soliciting the businessâ€™ requirements.</p>
							<p>While the matrix provides a high-level overview of the data warehouse presentation layer â€œpuzzleÂ piecesâ€ and their ultimate linkages, it is often helpful to provide more detail as each matrix row isÂ implemented. Multiple fact tables often result from a single business process. Perhaps thereâ€™s a needÂ to view business results in a combination of transaction, periodic snapshot or accumulating snapshotÂ perspectives. Alternatively, multiple fact tables are often required to represent atomic versus moreÂ summarized information or to support richer analysis in a heterogeneous product environment.</p>
							<p>We can alter the matrixâ€™s â€œgrainâ€ or level of detail so that each row represents a single fact table (orÂ cube) related to a business process. Once weâ€™ve specified the individual fact table, we canÂ supplement the matrix with columns to indicate the fact tableâ€™s granularity and corresponding factsÂ (actual, calculated or implied). Rather than merely marking the dimensions that apply to each factÂ table, we can indicate the dimensionsâ€™ level of detail (such as brand or category, as appropriate,Â within the product dimension column).</p>
							<p>The resulting embellished matrix provides a roadmap to the families of fact tables in your dataÂ warehouse. While many of us are naturally predisposed to dense details, we suggest you begin withÂ the more simplistic, high-level matrix and then drill-down into the details as each business process isÂ implemented. Finally, for those of you with an existing data warehouse, the detailed matrix is often aÂ useful tool to document the â€œas isâ€ status of a more mature warehouse environment.</p>
