							<p>Successful data warehouse and business intelligence solutions provide value by helping the businessÂ identify opportunities or address challenges. Obviously, itâ€™s risky business for the DW/BI team toÂ attempt delivering on this promise without understanding the business and its requirements. ThisÂ Design Tip covers basic guidelines for effectively determining the businessâ€™s wants and needs.</p>
							<p>First, start by properly preparing for the requirements process:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Do recruit a lead requirements analyst with the right stuff, including confidence and strongÂ communication and listening skills, coupled with the right knowledge, such as businessÂ acumen and vision for BIâ€™s potential.</li>
							<li>Do involve the right business representatives representing both vertical (cross managementÂ ranks) and horizontal (cross department) perspectives. Donâ€™t rely solely on the input from aÂ lone power analyst whoâ€™s a pseudo-IT professional.</li>
							<li>Donâ€™t presume you already know what the business wants because youâ€™ve supported themÂ for the past decade.</li>
							<li>Donâ€™t accept a static requirements document from the business which lists general itemsÂ such as â€œwe need the ability to quickly drill down into a single version of integrated data.â€</li>
							<li>Do differentiate between project and program requirements. While the mechanics are similar,Â there are differences in terms of the participants, breadth and depth of details collected,Â documentation, and next steps.</li>
							<li>Do get face-to-face with business representatives (or at least voice-to-voice). Donâ€™t rely onÂ non-interactive static surveys or questionnaires; donâ€™t think producing a 3â€ binder of existingÂ reports equates to requirements analysis.</li>
							<li>Do prepare interviewees in advance so you donâ€™t spend the first 30 minutes of every sessionÂ conceptually explaining DW/BI.Â Secondly, spend your time with the business representatives wisely:</li>
							<li>Do show up at the appointed meeting time. Donâ€™t allow your cell phone to ring (or casually tryÂ to figure out why itâ€™s vibrating).</li>
							<li>Do ask â€œwhat do you do (and why)â€; donâ€™t ask â€œwhat do you wantâ€ in the data warehouse orÂ pull out a list of data elements to determine whatâ€™s needed.</li>
							<li>Do ask unbiased open-ended why, how, what if, and what then questions. Do respect theÂ lead interviewerâ€™s or facilitatorâ€™s role in steering the sessions; donâ€™t turn it into a questioningÂ free-for-all.</li>
							<li>Do strive for a conversation flow; donâ€™t dive into the detailed weeds too quickly.</li>
							<li>Do listen intently to absorb like a sponge; donâ€™t allow the requirements team to do too muchÂ talking.</li>
							<li>Do conduct some sessions with source system experts to begin understanding the underlyingÂ data realities.</li>
							<li>Donâ€™t schedule more than four requirements sessions in a day; do allow time betweenÂ sessions to debrief.</li>
							<li>Do ask the business representatives for measurable success criteria (before thanking themÂ for their brilliant insights).</li>
							<li>Do set reasonable expectations with the business representatives about next steps; donâ€™tÂ leave it to their imaginations.Â Finally, bring the requirements gathering activities to an orderly conclusion:</li>
							<li>Do synthesize the findings into business process-centric categoriesÂ which representÂ manageable units of design andÂ development effort for the DW/BI team.</li>
							<li>Do write down what you heard (along with who said it and why itâ€™s required), but donâ€™t attemptÂ to reinvent an alternative Dewey Decimal System for classification and cross-footing. DetailedÂ project requirements can often be classified into three categories (data, BI application/reportÂ delivery, and technical architecture requirements) which correspond to downstream LifecycleÂ tasks.</li>
							<li>Donâ€™t allow the requirements gathering activities to be overcome by analysis paralysis orÂ process perfection.</li>
							<li>Do present your findings to senior executives to ensure a common understanding, reachÂ consensus about an overall roadmap, and establish next step priorities based on businessÂ value and feasibility.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Focusing on business requirements has always been a cornerstone of the Kimball approach; I firstÂ delivered a presentation on the topic at an industry conference in 1994. Much has changed in ourÂ industry over the past fifteen years, but the importance of effective requirements gathering hasÂ remained steadfast. Good luck with your requirements gathering initiative!</p>
